 <span style="color: white;">(Proverbs 10:15)</span> The rich manâ€™s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.
 <span style="color: white;">(Proverbs 11:10)</span>When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.
 <span style="color: white;">(Proverbs 11:11)</span>By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
 <span style="color: white;">(Proverbs 16:32)</span>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
 <span style="color: white;">(Proverbs 18:11)</span>The rich manâ€™s wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.
 <span style="color: white;">(Proverbs 18:19)</span>A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.
 <span style="color: white;">(Proverbs 21:22)</span>A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.
 <span style="color: white;">(Proverbs 25:28)</span>He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.
 <span style="color: white;">(Proverbs 29:8)</span>Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath.
 <span style="color: white;">(Ecclesiastes 7:19)</span>Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.

 <span style="color: white;">(Ecclesiastes 9:14)</span>There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:
 <span style="color: white;">(Ecclesiastes 9:15)</span>Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
